# ECProject

ECProject is an Android mobile application that leverages Retrofit for API communication and XML/DataBinding for user interface handling. The app follows a Single Activity architecture with multiple Fragments and aims to provide a smooth and efficient user experience.

## Features

- **Single Activity Architecture** with multiple fragments for a clean, modular design.
- **XML Layouts with DataBinding** for a more efficient, less error-prone UI development.
- **Retrofit Integration** for network operations and API calls.
- **ViewModel and Flows** for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Minimal Code in Activity** to keep the codebase clean and easy to maintain.
- **RoomDB for locally stored files. Responsive ui WITHOUT internet connection.
- **Jetpack Navigation for navigation between fragment with safe args.
